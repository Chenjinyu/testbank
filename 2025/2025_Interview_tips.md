## 🔧 2. What’s Changed in the Last 2 Years (and what to catch up on)

| Area                            | Why it matters                                                           | Your action                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Generative AI**               | Product + engineering now integrate LLMs, embeddings, RAG, etc.          | Learn basics of LLM usage & vector databases (e.g., LangChain + OpenAI APIs)   |
| **AI-integrated system design** | You’ll likely be asked how you’d architect AI-powered features           | Study “LLM in production” architectures (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) |
| **Cloud infra evolution**       | AWS CDK, EKS, serverless patterns are growing                            | Review IaC (Terraform/CDK), container orchestration (EKS, Fargate)             |
| **Fullstack frameworks**        | React/Next.js/Node evolving fast                                         | Refresh basics; explore monorepos (e.g., Turborepo, Nx)                        |
| **Tech leadership signals**     | Interviewers care more about **impact, vision, and cross-team delivery** | Prepare your **story bank**: team wins, architecture decisions, crisis handled |

## 📌 3. Interview Prep Focus (Principal-Level)

### 🧠 System Design

* Modern case studies:

  * AI-enhanced search engine
  * Event-driven systems with Kafka
  * Multi-region failover architecture
* Practice: Use **diagrams + tradeoffs** — not just textbook concepts

### 💬 Behavioral + Strategy

* Key themes:

  * “How do you coach a struggling senior dev?”
  * “Tell me about a time you challenged a product roadmap.”
  * “Describe how you drove alignment across multiple teams.”

📌 Tip: Use **STAR** (Situation–Task–Action–Result) + quantify impact

### ⚙️ Hands-on Coding (light touch)

* You may still face:

  * Small algorithmic problem (for technical bar)
  * Debugging or code review scenario

📌 Tip: Practice LeetCode *Easy/Medium*, GitHub PR reviews, or take-home design tasks

---

## 🧰 4. Resume Refresh Checklist

✅ Highlight:

* “Led design of system handling X req/sec with auto-scaling microservices in AWS”
* “Mentored 6+ engineers; created API style guide used org-wide”
* “Reduced integration time 30% by introducing contract-first API governance”

📌 Avoid:

* Outdated tech jargon (e.g., jQuery, SOAP unless relevant)
* Long bullet lists — focus on **impact + scale**

---

## 🔍 5. Where to Look

* **Principal/Staff Engineer** roles at:

  * SaaS / fintech companies
  * AI platform teams (infra + orchestration layer)
  * Internal tools/platforms (e.g., platform engineering)
* Titles may vary:

  * **Principal Engineer**
  * **Engineering Architect**
  * **Staff Engineer – APIs or Cloud Infra**

📌 Sites:

* **Wellfound (ex AngelList)** – early-stage opportunities
* **LinkedIn Jobs** – high-quality, filterable
* **Hired / Triplebyte** – signal-based job matching

* **Refresh your tech confidence**, especially in AI-aware architecture and cloud-native delivery
* **Practice just enough coding** to cross that final bar
