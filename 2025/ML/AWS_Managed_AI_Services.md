| Use in RAG pipelines    | ‚úÖ Yes                           |

## Here‚Äôs a complete **Python example** that uses **Amazon Bedrock** to:

1. Generate **text** from a prompt using **Claude 3**
2. (Optional) Create **embeddings** using **Titan Embeddings**
3. Integrate into a basic **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline

#### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

1. AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
2. Python 3.9+
3. Install SDK:

```bash
pip install boto3
```

4. Make sure Bedrock is enabled in your account and region (e.g., `us-east-1`)

#### üîπ Step 1: Text Generation with Claude 3

```python
import boto3
import json

bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')

response = bedrock.invoke_model(
    modelId='anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
    contentType='application/json',
    accept='application/json',
    body=json.dumps({
        "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
        "max_tokens": 300,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain what is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in simple terms."}
        ]
    })
)

output = json.loads(response['body'].read())
print("Claude says:\n", output['content'][0]['text'])
```

#### üîπ Step 2: Generate Embeddings (for RAG)

```python
embedder = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name='us-east-1')

embed_response = embedder.invoke_model(
    modelId="amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
    contentType="application/json",
    accept="application/json",
    body=json.dumps({"inputText": "How does SageMaker JumpStart help beginners?"})
)

embedding = json.loads(embed_response["body"].read())["embedding"]
print("Vector size:", len(embedding))
```

You can store this embedding in **Amazon OpenSearch**, **Pinecone**, **Faiss**, etc.

#### üîπ Step 3: Simulated RAG: Search + Prompt Inject

```python
# Simulated document chunks
docs = [
    "SageMaker JumpStart provides pretrained models and solution templates.",
    "It helps users start with machine learning quickly and with minimal code.",
    "You can use models for text, vision, tabular, and more."
]

query = "How does JumpStart help new ML users?"

# Generate embedding for the query
query_embedding = json.loads(embedder.invoke_model(
    modelId="amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
    contentType="application/json",
    accept="application/json",
    body=json.dumps({"inputText": query})
)["body"].read())["embedding"]

# Simulate similarity scoring (dot product or cosine)
from numpy import dot
from numpy.linalg import norm
import numpy as np

def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    return dot(a, b) / (norm(a) * norm(b))

# Simulate retrieving top-k documents
similarities = [cosine_similarity(query_embedding, json.loads(embedder.invoke_model(
    modelId="amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
    contentType="application/json",
    accept="application/json",
    body=json.dumps({"inputText": doc})
)["body"].read())["embedding"]) for doc in docs]

# Get most relevant doc
top_doc = docs[np.argmax(similarities)]

# Inject into Claude
response = bedrock.invoke_model(
    modelId='anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0',
    contentType='application/json',
    accept='application/json',
    body=json.dumps({
        "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
        "max_tokens": 300,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Using the following document:\n\n{top_doc}\n\nAnswer this: {query}"}
        ]
    })
)

output = json.loads(response['body'].read())
print("\nRAG-based answer:\n", output['content'][0]['text'])
```

#### ‚úÖ Summary

| Task                   | Tool/Model                      |

   Store raw data in **Amazon S3**.

2. **Create a Labeling Job**
   Define the task (e.g., object detection), instructions, and workforce.

3. **Humans & Models Label the Data**

   * Humans label the data via a web UI.
   * Ground Truth learns and begins **auto-labeling** new data when confident.

4. **Store Labeled Output**
   Results go back to S3 in JSON format, ready for training ML models.

##### üì¶ **Sample Output Format (for classification)**

```json
{
  "source-ref": "s3://your-bucket/image1.jpg",
  "label": "cat",
  "label-metadata": {
    "confidence": 0.98,
    "job-name": "classification-job",
    "human-annotated": "yes"
  }
}
```

##### üí∞ **Pricing**

You pay for:

* **Data labeling by humans** (varies by workforce and task complexity)
* **Storage** (S3)
* **Optional auto-labeling compute time**

üí° **Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus** is a fully managed labeling service (you provide data, AWS manages everything end-to-end).

##### ‚úÖ **When to Use SageMaker Ground Truth**

* You need to create **large-scale labeled datasets**
* You want to **combine human and machine labeling**
* You need **high-quality labels** for production ML models
* You‚Äôre working with **image, text, video, or 3D sensor data**

import mlflow.sklearn

with mlflow.start_run():
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 5)
    mlflow.log_metric("rmse", 0.43)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

4. **Deploy MLflow Model to SageMaker**

```python
import mlflow.sagemaker

mlflow.sagemaker.deploy(
    app_name="my-mlflow-model",
    model_uri="runs:/<run_id>/model",
    region_name="us-west-2",
    mode="create"
)
```

##### üì¶ **Architecture Option: Hosting MLflow on AWS**
