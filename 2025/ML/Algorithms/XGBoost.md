## Methodology

The machine learning method used in this project is XGBoost. XGBoost is an advanced gradient boosting algorithm that combines the strengths of gradient boosting and regularization techniques. It optimizes a specific loss function using gradient descent and Newton's method to improve model performance.

XGBoost handles categorical features using one-hot encoding or target encoding. One-hot encoding converts categorical features into binary vectors, representing the presence or absence of a category. Target encoding assigns a numerical value to each category based on the target variable's mean or probability.

To optimize the loss function, XGBoost uses gradient descent and Newton's method. Gradient descent updates the model's parameters in the direction of steepest descent to minimize the loss function. Newton's method approximates the second-order derivative of the loss function to improve convergence speed and stability.

XGBoost prevents overfitting using regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty term based on the absolute values of the model's parameters, encouraging sparsity. L2 regularization adds a penalty term based on the squared values of the parameters, promoting smoother solutions. Early stopping is another technique used to prevent overfitting by monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping the training process when no improvement is observed.

The model's hyperparameters were selected through a combination of manual tuning and grid search. The key hyperparameters and their functionalities are as follows:

- learning_rate: Controls the step size during the optimization process. A smaller learning rate slows down learning but can improve model performance.
- max_depth: Specifies the maximum depth of each tree in the ensemble. A larger max_depth can lead to overfitting, while a smaller value may result in underfitting.
- n_estimators: Determines the number of trees in the ensemble. A higher number of estimators can increase model complexity but may also increase training time.
- subsample: Controls the fraction of samples used for training each tree. A smaller subsample can improve generalization but may increase variance.
- colsample_bytree: Controls the fraction of features used for training each tree. A smaller colsample_bytree can reduce overfitting by introducing randomness.


## Experiments/Results/Discussion

The model was trained and evaluated using a training set, validation set, and test set. The dataset was split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. Cross-validation was performed using k-fold cross-validation with k=5 to assess the model's performance and reduce overfitting.

The main metrics used to evaluate the model's performance were accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the predictions. Precisionmeasures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances. The F1-score combines precision and recall into a single metric. AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances.

### Discussion

![Variable](https://github.com/KindlyGentleman/DS-DA-Bank-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/docs/images/XGBoost%20Variable.png)

![Correlation](https://github.com/KindlyGentleman/DS-DA-Bank-Churn-Prediction/blob/main/docs/images/Correlation.png)

The model succeeded in predicting customer churn to a certain extent, achieving high accuracy and reasonable precision for class 0 (customers who did not exit). However, the model struggled to accurately identify customers who actually exited the bank, resulting in lower recall and precision values for class 1.

One possible reason for the model's limitations could be the class imbalance in the dataset, with a higher number of instances belonging to class 0. This class imbalance can bias the model towards predicting the majority class, resulting in lower performance for the minority class.

To address this issue, different strategies can be employed, such as resampling techniques (e.g., oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class) or using advanced algorithms specifically designed for imbalanced datasets (e.g., SMOTE, ADASYN).

Additionally, further feature engineering and selection techniques can be explored to improve the model's performance. Feature engineering methods, such as creating interaction terms or deriving new features from existing ones, can capture additional patterns and relationships in the data. Feature selection techniques, such as recursive feature elimination or regularization, can help identify the most relevant features for predicting churn.

Furthermore, fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters and exploring ensemble methods (e.g., stacking or boosting multiple models) can enhance the model's predictive power and generalization capabilities.

Overall, while the model provides valuable insights and shows potential in predicting customer churn, there is room for improvement and further experimentation to achieve higher accuracy and recall for class 1.

### Conclusion/Future Work

In conclusion, the churn prediction project for bank customer data using the XGBoost algorithm provides valuable insights into customer behavior and characteristics that influence churn. The machine learning model successfully predicts customer churn to a certain extent, demonstrating the potential to identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

Future work could involve further model refinement and optimization, considering the specific challenges posed by imbalanced datasets and the need for improved recall and precision for class 1 (customers who exited). Exploring advanced feature engineering techniques, such as interaction terms and derived features, could capture more nuanced patterns and improve the model's predictive power. Additionally, experimenting with different ensemble methods and hyperparameter tuning strategies can enhance the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

Given more time, resources, and computational power, it would be beneficial to explore other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance to the XGBoost model. Conducting more extensive experiments, potentially including different feature selection methods and handling techniques for imbalanced datasets, can provide deeper insights into the problem of bank customer churn and improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the prediction model.

Ultimately, by leveraging machine learning techniques and continuously refining the model, banks can gain valuable insights into customer churn, identify at-risk customers, and develop proactive strategies to retain valuable customers and increase overall revenue and market share.
