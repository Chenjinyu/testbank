Great question!

# What “blast-radius isolation” means

It’s the practice of **designing systems so a failure only hurts a small, predefined area** (the “blast radius”) instead of cascading across everything. You assume something *will* break—then add boundaries so the impact is contained.

# Why it matters

* Prevents one noisy tenant / bad deploy / hot partition from taking down others
* Makes incident response smaller, faster, and cheaper
* Lets teams ship independently (safer rollouts & rollbacks)

# Common isolation layers (with AWS examples)

1. **Account / Region / AZ**

   * Separate AWS **accounts** for prod vs non-prod or per product line
   * Multi-AZ by default; consider active/standby **multi-region** for critical APIs

2. **Networking**

   * One VPC per environment; **private subnets** for services
   * **Security Groups** limit east-west traffic; optional **AWS WAF** at the edge

3. **Compute**

   * **One service per ECS Service** (or per tenant) with its own Auto Scaling
   * Prefer **Fargate** for hard CPU/memory isolation per task
   * Set container **resource limits** (CPU/mem), ulimits, and health checks

4. **Edge / Traffic**

   * **API Gateway** (or ALB) per domain/service with **per-route throttling/quotas**
   * Use **rate limiting**/burst control to protect backends
   * **Blue/green or canary** deployments per service to confine bad releases

5. **Data**

   * **DB-per-service** (or schema/table per service) to avoid cross-coupling
   * For DynamoDB: **table per service or per tenant**, partition keys that prevent hot partitions, **RCU/WCU** limits per table
   * Separate **KMS keys** and **IAM policies** per service/tenant

6. **Streaming & Queues**

   * **Kinesis**: separate streams (or at least shards/consumers) per domain; use **Enhanced Fan-Out** so one slow consumer doesn’t throttle others
   * **SQS** buffers between services; add **DLQs** to quarantine poison messages

7. **Runtime Resilience**

   * **Timeouts, retries with jittered backoff, circuit breakers** (App Mesh/Envoy or in-app)
   * **Idempotency** for producers/consumers to enable safe retries

8. **Observability & Controls**

   * Per-service **SLOs/alerts**, dashboards, error budgets
   * **FireLens** (Fluent Bit) to route logs per service to Splunk/Datadog
   * **Otel** tracing per service; isolate noisy metrics/log volumes with quotas

# How this maps to your stack (FastAPI on ECS)

* **Edge**: Put **API Gateway (HTTP API)** in front with throttling & JWT/IAM auth. That alone prevents a sudden traffic spike from drowning FastAPI.
* **Compute**: One **ECS Service per API** (and optionally per tenant). Use **Fargate**, set CPU/memory limits, and separate autoscaling policies.
* **Data**: If multi-tenant, prefer **DynamoDB table per tenant** (silo) or strong logical isolation (pooled) with **fine-grained IAM** and partition design; never share write hot spots.
* **Async boundaries**: Put heavy or non-critical paths behind **SQS** or **Kinesis** with DLQs, so a single failing consumer doesn’t stop the API.
* **Deployments**: Blue/green via **CodeDeploy for ECS** so a bad release only affects its own service.
* **Obs**: Per-service dashboards/alerts; fail a single target group/Service, not the entire cluster.

# Quick checklist

* Separate **prod vs non-prod** into different AWS **accounts**
* **API Gateway** in front with throttles; **WAF** for basic protections
* One ECS **Service** per API/tenant; **Fargate** with hard limits
* **DB/table per service**; KMS keys & IAM scoped per service
* **Queues/streams** between services + DLQs
* Timeouts/retries/circuit breakers; idempotency keys
* Per-service SLOs and alarms; canary/blue-green deploys

If you want, tell me which parts of your system are multi-tenant or most failure-prone, and I’ll turn this into a targeted isolation plan (diagram + step list) for your exact setup.
