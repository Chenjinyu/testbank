"""
You are a programmer in a scientific team doing research into particles.
As an experiment, you have measured the position of a single particle in N equally distributed moments of time.
The measurement made in moment K is recorded in array A as A[K]

Now, your job is to count all the periods of time when the movement of the particle was stable.
those are the periods during which the particle doesn't change its velocity. 
i.e. the different betwwen any two consecutive position measurements remains the same.
Note that you need at least three measurements to be sure that the particle did not change its velocity.

Examples:
