## The coding questions will focus on Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object Oriented Design.
###Data Structures:
* Array
* Linked List
* Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree
* Heap
* Hash Table
* Stack
* Queue
* Trie
* Graph (both directed and undirected)
* Disjoint-set
 
### Algorithms:
* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Search
* Sorting
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Radix/Bucket Sort
* Traversals (On multiple data structures)

from other website:
1. Binary Search    
2. DFS, BFSï¼ŒBest FS     
3. Iteration /recursion     
4. LinkedList     
5. Graph/tree     
6. Queue/Stack/Heap     
7. DP   
8. Array/String     
9. Set/HashMap 
10. Bit
11. Sliding window    
12. Sorting   
13. Multiple pointers   
14. Trie etc.
