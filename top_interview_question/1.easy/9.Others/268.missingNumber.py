"""
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

Algorithm: [A]
âˆ‘ n    i = n (n + 1) / 2    
  i=0  	
  
  
Note:
Think about if the number does not start with 0, but it's n= [k, k + 1, K+ 2, ... k + m]. and it has a long items.
one of my solutions is:
1. sort them.
2. find the mid_pos, if the nums[mid_pos] > k + (k + m) / 2, the missing number should be the left side, vice versa.

could we use the algorithm [A]? I think it will be more efficience.
