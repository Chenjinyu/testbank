516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.
You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
Input:
"bbbab"
Output:
4
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Example 2:
Input:
"cbbd"
Output:
2
One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
